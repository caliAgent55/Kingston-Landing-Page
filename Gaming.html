    <p class="Gaming"> Gaming is something Kingston has been passionate about since he learned to use a touch screen device. As he grew older, his tastes have changed. Long gone are the days when simple games like Flappy Bird and Temple Run were suficient. Nowadays he plays RPS like Raid: Shadow Lords, FPS such as CoD, sports games like Rocket League and NBA2k 20, as well as MineCraft, Roblox, and recently Rust.</p>
