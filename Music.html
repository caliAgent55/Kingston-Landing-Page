    <p class="Music">Kinsgton started playing around with the music 
        production software FL Studios and its quickly blossomed 
        into a real passion. He makes music almost everyday and 
        has songs uploaded to <a
        href="https://soundcloud.com/user-715807321">SoundCloud</a>
        <br />
         and videos on <a
         href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJRuMUTPMhdIeD10cGoF84w">YouTube</a>
         <br />. Kingston's musical genres are Lo-Fi and trap. He is beginning to utilize vocal samples in his projects and we hope he will one day pick up guitar and saxophone again, adding to his musical repertoire.</p>
