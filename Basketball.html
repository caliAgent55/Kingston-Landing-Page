        Kingston's desire to play basketball started in 2018 after returning from a summer holiday in Shanghai. He started off taking a basketball class held at his elementary school Monday evenings. His competitive drive grew quickly, as did his motivation to play more so we looked for a team. 
        His first team was St. Joachim in Hayward, CA. His coaches recognized his potential and introduced us to coach Marques Smith, founder of Breakdown Hoops. He has grown tremendously under his training, landing him a spot on the OTD Elite Team (formerly the Nor Cal Lions Black Team). <a
